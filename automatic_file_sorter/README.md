# 1. Automatic File Sorter

A simple Python script that automatically organizes files in a folder by their types (e.g., Documents, Images, Videos). This is a great utility to keep your directories clean and structured.

- Sorts files into categorized subfolders:
  - Documents
  - Images
  - Videos

  - Archives
  - Scripts
  - Others
- Skips folders and only sorts files.
- Works in the current working directory.

## How It Works

1. The script defines a dictionary with common file types and their extensions.
2. It scans the current directory.
3. It checks the extension of each file.
4. It moves each file to a matching subfolder.
5. If a file doesn’t match any known type, it goes into an `Others` folder.

## Example

```
/myfolder
├── image1.jpg
├── doc1.pdf
├── video1.mp4
├── script.py
├── random.xyz

```

After running the script:
```
/myfolder
├── Documents
│ └── doc1.pdf
├── Images
│ └── image1.jpg
├── Videos
│ └── video1.mp4
├── Scripts
│ └── script.py
├── Others
└── random.xyz
```
